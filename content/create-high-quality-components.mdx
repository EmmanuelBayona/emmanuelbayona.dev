Create high-quality, type-safe, reusable React components with TypeScript and tailwindcss.

## Install Dependencies
Install necessary dependencies to make everything easier. The following example is from a Nextjs 13 project with TypeScript.

### clsx
A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)

```bash
npm install clsx
```

### tailwind-merge
Utility function to efficiently merge Tailwind CSS classes in JS without style conflicts.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)

```bash
npm install tailwind-merge
```

### class-variance-authority
CSS-in-TS type-safe library that allows us to easily define and apply CSS class variatons.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-variance-authority)

```bash
npm install class-variance-authority
```

## Create Variances
We need to use the class-variance-authority to create different variances of out component,
using tailwind. It is actually very simple. we just need to `import {cva} from 'class-variance-authority'` and declare
our variances.

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
export const buttonVariants = cva(
	// Base props that all variants will have
	"text-white text-base font-semibold text-center rounded-lg cursor-pointer py-1",
	{
		variants: {
			variant: {
					default: "bg-accent-1 border border-accent-2",
					primaryGreen: "gradient-lr border border-accent-green",
			},
			size: {
					default: "w-auto px-2",
					fullWidth: "w-full",
					small: "w-auto px-1",
					medium: "w-auto px-2",
					large: "w-auto px-4",
			},
			defaultVariants: {
					variant: "default",
					size: "default",
			},
		},
	}
);
```

As you can see, we have a `buttonVariants` object that contains all the variances of our button component.
The first line of styles are the base styles that all variances will have. Then we have the `variants` object
that contains all the different variances. In this case, we have `variant` and `size`. 
- **variant** is the different color schemes that our button can have.
- **size** is the different sizes that our button can have.
DefaultVariants is where we define the default values for our variances.

We export our `buttonVariants` object so that we can use it other components, and share the same variances.

## Util function (tailwind-merge)
Firs we need to import `clsx` and `twMerge` from their respective packages, and then we can create a function
that will merge our classes.

```tsx title="utils.ts"
import { ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";
export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```

This function will take in any number of classes, and merge them together. This is useful when we applyu our variances
or if we want to add extra classes to our component.

## Types
Let's create an interface for our component, in this case, a button.

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
import { ButtonHTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
export interface ButtonProps
  extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}
```

The interface `ButtonProps` extends `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` so that we can use all the props that
a button element can have. Then we extend `VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>` so that we can use all the variances
that we defined in our `buttonVariants` object.

## Component
Now we can create our component. We will use the `cn` function that we created earlier to merge our classes.

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
import { forwardRef } from "react";
import { cn } from "./utils";
export const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
	({ className, size, variant, ...props }, ref) => {
		return (
			<button
				ref={ref}
				className={cn(buttonVariants({ className, size, variant }))}
				{...props}
			/>
		);
	}
);
```
As you can see, we import `forwardRef` from react, this is so that we can use refs in our component, because `ref` cannot be passed
as a prop.
We use `forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>` to forward the ref to the button element, and to use our `ButtonProps` interface.
We destructure `className`, `size`, and `variant` from `props` so that we can use them in our `cn` function. By getting `...props` we
can use all the default props that a button element can have.

## Usage
Now we can use our component in our app.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Button } from "./Button";
export default function App() {
	return (
		<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen py-2">
			<Button variant="primaryGreen" size="large">
				Button Text
			</Button>;
		</div>
	);
}
```
