A site to learn, practice and share cube puzzles algorithms.

One of my hobbies has always been solving cube puzzles, and I have always been interested in learning
and practicing new algorithms to solve them faster. This site is a place where I can store and share 
the algorithms I have learned and practiced.

All users can access the site and see the algorithms, and even practice with the Timer. 
Registeded users can also upload their own algorithms and share them with the community.

You can check the site [here](https://cubes.emmanuelbayona.dev/). The site is inspired
by [AldDB.net](http://algdb.net/), a site I have been using for years to learn and practice algorithms. 
I wanted to create a site with this concept where users can check for algorithms and also upload them, with a 
huge focus on the user experience and design, and with new features like the Timer.


## Technologies
Made with Next.js for taking advantage of server side rendering and static site generation.
The site is hosted on Vercel, and uses Supabase as a database to store the algorithms and users data.

The components are build on top of RadixUI and TailwindCSS, taking as inspiration shadcn/ui as the way 
of creating components and styles.

Finally for authentication I used Clerk, one of the best tools I have used for authentication, the developer experience
that Clerk provides is amazing. The user roles and permissions of the site are managed with Clerk as well.

## Features
- **Algorithms**: Users can see the algorithms.
- **Timer**: Users can practice their times with the integrated Timer.
- **Upload algorithms**: Registered users can upload their own algorithms, create their own cases and share them with the community.
